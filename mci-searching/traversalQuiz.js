//1) if you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
BFS()

//2) if the tree is very deep and solutions are rare,
BFS (DFS-will-take-long-time)

//3) if the tree is ver wide
DFS (BFS-will-need-too-much-memory)

//4) if solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS()

//5) determing whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS()

//6) finding the shortest path
BFS()
