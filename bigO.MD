Big O Cheat Sheet

Big Os

O(1) Constant - no loops
O(log N) Logarithmic - usually searching algorithms have log n if that are sorted (Binary Search)
O(n) Linear - for loops, while loops through n items
O(n log(n)) - Log Linear - usually sorting operations
O(n^2) Quadratic - every element in a collection needs to be compared to every other element. Two nested loops
O(2^n) Exponential - recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
O(n!)  Factorial - you are adding a loop for every element

Iterating through half a collection is still O(n) *specifically O(n/2)*
Two separate collections: O(a * b)

Rule Book
Rule 1: Always worst case
Rule 2: Remove Constante
Rule 3: Different inputs should have different variables. O(a+b). A and B arrays nested would be O(a*b), + for steps in order, * for nested steps
Rule 4: Drop Non-dominant terms
